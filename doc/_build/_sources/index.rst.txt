gspread-helpers 
===============

A simple Python package which provides supplementary helper methods for 
`gspread <https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.

The raison d'Ãªtre for this Python package is to provide a single repository 
for miscellaneous helper methods that aide engineers using ``gspread`` but 
which may not warrant addition to the official ``gspread`` project via pull 
request.

Currently, this package includes a single module helper method--namely, ``RangeName``. 
Additional methods and modules will be added on an ad hoc basis--that is, as
the need arises.
